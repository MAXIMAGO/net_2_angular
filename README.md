# Net2angular

Finally we shwocase some of the features we talked about as well as some pratical ideas to play around with.

Since we modelled two projects in this wokrspace you have to build the dependant project before you can begin serving the main project.
In this case we provide a npm script build:core to build the so called m-core module.

```bash
npm run build:core
```

once the core module has been build proceed with the usual

```bash
npm run start
```

Feel free to browse the ideas implemented as well as altering them for your own practice.
